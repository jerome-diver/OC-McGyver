   The game is a 2 dimensions board game. It is ot so nice, but i use
   some Python technics for learn things to do.

   I use MVC design structure and i provide a UML scheme (please, if you
   want to update things, do update this UML draw with, i drawn it with
   Dia free software). I think this code should be a good demo example
   demo for pygame and for MVC structure. But i'm sure it should be
   better, teach me please.
